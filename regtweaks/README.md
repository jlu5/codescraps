Registry tweaks for my Windows 7 systems. **You probably do not want to run these unless you know what you're doing.**

##### AlwaysShowHidden.reg
- Always show file extensions and hidden files. Also modifies the system defaults (for new users)

##### NoOEMBackground.reg
- Disables Windows 7's OEM login screen background.

##### OpenCmdWindow.reg
- Makes the "Open command window here" context menu item always show up (default only shows up if you Shift-click a folder).

##### PuttyDefaults.reg
- My default settings for the PuTTY SSH Client. No passwords/account details here, just a custom colour scheme and a few settings!

##### SetWMPAlbumArtGeneration.reg
- Disables WMP's stupid auto-generation/overwriting of album-art images. Relatively untested at this point.
