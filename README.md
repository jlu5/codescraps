# codescraps

GLolol's collection of code scraps. Most of the semi-useful/interesting stuff is in the repository root, but there are more scraps than anything else in the **scraps/** folder.

Most of the code here is licensed under the MIT license (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)), unless otherwise specified.

Enjoy!

##### random/randomjunk.py
- Literally generates a pile of random junk in your terminal. Can be coloured too (**&#126;&#126;amaze&#126;&#126;**)!

##### utils/h.py
- Recursive HTTP/meta-refresh redirect expander.

##### utils/passwd.py
